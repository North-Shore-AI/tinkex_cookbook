# Phase 3 - Remaining Examples (Placeholder)

**Goal:** complete the remaining recipes and optional integrations after Phase 2.

This phase is intentionally a placeholder until Phase 2 stabilizes.

## Expected Remaining Areas

- `math_rl` (if not already completed)
- `tool_use/search` (chromadb via `chroma` + google-genai)
- `multiplayer_rl` (textarena)
- `verifiers_rl` (verifiers + openai)
- `rubric` recipes
- `vlm_classifier` recipes
- `preference/rlhf` and `preference/shorter` (if deferred)

## Placeholder Tasks

- Port remaining configs with ChzEx
- Add SnakeBridge manifests or native alternatives as needed
- Expand test coverage to all recipes
- Finalize docs and examples
